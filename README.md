Personal Protfolio as well as any designs or projects I come up with.
I thought to myself one day whilst lamenting lacking a definative style that I liked that a portfolio site for a developer is simply a CV with extra steps.
Why not then, create a CV with Extra steps.

This project starts with my official CV and works from there. Then after being congratulated with the idea was told by a coworker that they wished they could come up with an idea for thier own site. It occured to me that this problem is systemic with my fellow Devs. So why not "Think of my fellow man,Lend him a helping hand..." by making this something accessable. 

This site is my personal version of the [ModifiedPortfolio](https://github.com/GeneticallyModifiedAlex/ModifiedPortfolio) an open sourced project to give people the start they need. All that is needed is to fill in your relevant details and this will load to your page. Instructions on exporting it to github pages will be included. I wish you all the best.
(Possible [Next.js](https://dev.to/jameswallis/deploying-a-next-js-app-to-github-pages-24pn) vesion in the future).
